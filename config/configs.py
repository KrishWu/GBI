"""Configuration parameters for R-Anode analysis.

This module defines the signal region boundaries and other analysis
parameters used throughout the R-Anode workflow. The signal region
is defined based on the LHCO R&D dataset specifications for W' searches.
"""

# Signal region boundaries in TeV
# Based on W' → X(qq)Y(qq) search with mW' = 3.5 TeV
SR_MIN = 3.3  # TeV - Lower bound of signal region
SR_MAX = 3.7  # TeV - Upper bound of signal region
